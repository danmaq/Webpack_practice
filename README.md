# Webpack practice

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. Run `yarn run build`.
    * Here, the dependency of the module is resolved and the built source is created in the dist folder.
4. Let's check working.
    * Windows `start dist\index.html`
    * macOS / Linux `open dist/index.html`
